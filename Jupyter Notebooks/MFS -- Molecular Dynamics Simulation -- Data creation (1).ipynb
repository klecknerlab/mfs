    "#### Description:\n",
    "The following notebook makes use of the method of fundamental solutions to compute the sound scattered from multiple sound hard scattering bodies. It determines the forces resultant from said scattering events, some of which are non-linear interactions brought about by interference of acoustic fields. The force data from the MFS scattering code is then fed into a Runge-Kutta based step integrator to produce a molecular dynamics type simulator."
