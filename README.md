# mfs

This repository contains a Python-based acoustic scattering code based on
the method of fundamental solutions (MFS).

It can be installed using `setup.py`; presently we recommend installing in
developer mode (`python setup.py develop`), as it is under active development.

In the `examples` directory you will find some examples of computing forces
and plotting acoustic fields.

The `doc_notebooks` directory contains stand-alone Jupyter notebooks that
document the numerical method.  For general purpose use, however, the `mfs`
module should be used instead, as it contains a number of optimizations.
